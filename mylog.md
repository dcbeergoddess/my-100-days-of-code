### Day 0: March 1, 2021
##### Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design

**Today's Progress**: Getting Coding Brain Active Again with BACK TO THE BASICS using Free Code Camp Challenges. I learned to create your own CSS properties by creating the value using -- `--penguin-skin: gray` and reference it for other properties `background: var(--penguin-skin)`

**Thoughts:** I really like the way Free Code Camp is set up to make me code. All coming back pretty quickly and remembering little tricks and stuff. This will be engrained in my brain!!!

### Day 1: March 2, 2021
##### Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design Cont

**Today's Progress:** MORE Free Code Camp Challenges. Getting my Brain Muscles working. Refreshed on early Positioning. Good to understand these properties. But FlexBox on other libraries allow us to better structure our code when we start writing our own big projects. 

**Thoughts:** Need to really work my head around `relative` and `absolute` and `fixed` positioning. Doing good on inheritance. Similar to functions and how it matters what inherits what and how code is going to read and affected by the order. If using position `absolute` make sure parent element position rule to parent element, usually `relative`. `fixed` does not move when user scrolls. `sticky` - last one. `z-index` to create stack order for elements on top of each other (i wonder what new tech is used for that now). `margin: auto` = item center, `display: block` = img no longer inline

##### More Free Code Camp - Responsive Web Design

**Today's Progress:** Created simple website to start putting snippets for graphic and animations I'm learning to do with CSS

**Thoughts:** Creating from scratch and coding is fun!! Hoping that creating this site and putting my notes into an actual website will help with remember what is available at my finger tips without having to import a ton of libraries

### Day 3: March 4, 2021
##### Right Accessible Code

**Today's Progress:** After a few challenges on Free Code Camp under Applied Accessibility and review of best practices for Screen Readers I started a page for my Yarn Projects to illustrate best practices. HTML5 introduction better semantic tags like nav, main, article you can see used throughout React and CSS Libraries like bootstrap. 
**Thoughts:** Started a skelton html page that I want to develop into a full blow marketing page for my future designs. Good to start full page from scratch and run into the stupid mistakes like not linking pictures right.

### Day 4: March 5, 2021
##### Style and Organize my Snippets Website

**Today's Progress:** Set up a more streamline design and bootstrap elements to the snippets website
**Thoughts:** Enjoyed using some of the skills I just learned again and went ahead to play around with Bootstrap which came pretty quickly and remmbered all the link that were required after running into issues with the nav bar not working.
