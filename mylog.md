### Day 0: March 1, 2021
##### Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design

**Today's Progress**: Getting Coding Brain Active Again with BACK TO THE BASICS using Free Code Camp Challenges. I learned to create your own CSS properties by creating the value using -- `--penguin-skin: gray` and reference it for other properties `background: var(--penguin-skin)`
**Thoughts:** I really like the way Free Code Camp is set up to make me code. All coming back pretty quickly and remembering little tricks and stuff. This will be engrained in my brain!!!

### Day 1: March 2, 2021
##### Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design Cont

**Today's Progress:** MORE Free Code Camp Challenges. Getting my Brain Muscles working. Refreshed on early Positioning. Good to understand these properties. But FlexBox on other libraries allow us to better structure our code when we start writing our own big projects. 
**Thoughts:** Need to really work my head around `relative` and `absolute` and `fixed` positioning. Doing good on inheritance. Similar to functions and how it matters what inherits what and how code is going to read and affected by the order. If using position `absolute` make sure parent element position rule to parent element, usually `relative`. `fixed` does not move when user scrolls. `sticky` - last one. `z-index` to create stack order for elements on top of each other (i wonder what new tech is used for that now). `margin: auto` = item center, `display: block` = img no longer inline

### Day 3: March 4, 2021
##### Right Accessible Code

**Today's Progress:** After a few challenges on Free Code Camp under Applied Accessibility and review of best practices for Screen Readers I started a page for my Yarn Projects to illustrate best practices. HTML5 introduction better semantic tags like nav, main, article you can see used throughout React and CSS Libraries like bootstrap. 
**Thoughts:** Started a skelton html page that I want to develop into a full blow marketing page for my future designs. Good to start full page from scratch and run into the stupid mistakes like not linking pictures right.
